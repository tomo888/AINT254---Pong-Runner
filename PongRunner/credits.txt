how hard do you find the level
- too hard; obstacles from left impossible to predict, too fast, swivelling too hard to manouvere past

how long should powerups last for

should the paddle be able to rotate?
- overwhelmingly yes

should the player lose a life if the ball hits the bottom wall?
= no, too hard

any bugs?
- ball goes too fast when hit at certain angle

- ball appears very jittery when moving

= ball stops when hit at certain angle

- ball rebounds off of something that isn't the wall (invisible walls glitch)

any improvements?

= bug fixing
= add countdown timer 
- make levels shorter
